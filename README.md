# Credit_card_fraud
In this project, I will work on the dataset (based on a synthetic financial dataset), that represents a typical set of credit card transactions. transactions.csv is the original dataset which contains one thousand transactions. My goal is to use Logistic Regression and create a predictive model to determine if a transaction is fraudulent or not.
